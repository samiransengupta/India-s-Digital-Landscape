## 📌 Project Overview 
## This project explores India's Digital Landscape using unit-level data from the Comprehensive Annual Modular Survey (CAMS), NSS 79th Round: 2022–23. 
## The analysis uncovered disparities in broadband access, mobile penetration, and digital skills, and was featured in a co-authored article in The Hindu and a Tableau story dashboard.

## 🧠 Key Research Questions in the frame work of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
- What proportion of households have broadband access within their premises?
- How deep is mobile penetration in India?
- What basic ICT skill sets do Indians possess?
- Do disparities exist along lines of geography, caste, class, or gender?
